# Project 2

## Topic: 
Building an interface that allows users to see the top 10 restaurants in a city of their choosing using Yelp API, HTML, CSS, JS, and the Algolia Places JS library.

## Articulation: 

  We remembered the original question posed to us at the beginning of this bootcamp and thought to expand on it. Are Italian or Mexican restaurants more popular in the U.S.? We came up with using the Yelp dataset to create a simpler version of Yelpâ€™s GUI that limits what is shown to the top 10 restaurants based on the city the user is in. A lot of data suggests that when users are presented with too many options, they tend to give up and not choose anything. But when presented with a few options, they are able to/more likely decide on an item and follow through with purchasing it.
	For example, when you walk down the aisles of a grocery store and go to the ice cream section, there are at least 15-20 brands with 5+ choices of flavors and some even have different size options (pint, gallon, bars, sandwiches, etc). How do you choose just one? Brand loyalty? Flavor? Dietary restriction? Texture (with or without inclusions)? But if there were only 5 flavors, you would be able to choose rather quickly. 
  We are trying to apply the same logic on restaurant choice by narrowing it down to the top 10. We may try to go one step further and allow the user to choose the type of restaurant they are in the mood for (Italian, Mexican, etc). Ultimately, this would be useful for people who travel or might be going to a new city for work since they would be new to the area.
